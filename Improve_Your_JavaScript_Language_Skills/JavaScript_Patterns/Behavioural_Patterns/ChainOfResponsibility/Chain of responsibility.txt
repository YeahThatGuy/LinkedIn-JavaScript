The Chain of Responsibility is a pattern to help solve 
common practical issues of having a request from a client 
and needing this request to pass through multiple functions 
or logic to get the result.

What we end up with is a request going through an abstract handler 
which calls one function or handler after another until the chain is 
completed. When one handler is completed, we can go to the next one. 
If there are errors, the abstract handler can provide error information 
to the back end end client, and so on and so forth.
